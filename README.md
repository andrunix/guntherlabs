Gunther Labs
============

Gunther Labs is my small freelance software development and web
design company.

This is the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the site.

What's with the name?
---------------------
Why is the site called Gunther Labs? When I worked for a large 
insurance company, we had a monster of a machine made by a 
company called Gunther. It did super high-speed printing, 
folding, and envelope stuffing for monthly statements. It was
kept in a big room that was referred to as the "Gunther Lab".

The machine got moved out of that building but that room was 
forever known as the Gunther Lab. At one point, we setup a 
webcam in that room so that you could see what was going on in
there without walking all the way down there. I got creative
and registered a domain and put the webcam feed on the internet.

Eventually, someone removed the webcam and I let the domain die.
I always thought the name was kind of catchy and I decided to
use it for my freelance business. 

I know, I'm a dork. ;)
